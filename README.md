# Zenoh Node C#
C# port of zenoh-node-rs. This library is integrated into my ninja-trader-server application to enable communication with TradeBot Rust application via the Zenoh protocol. NinjaTrader only offers a .NET DLL to use their API so I chose to write a C# implementation of Zenoh Node to communicate between the two applications.

# Installation
The Zenoh C API needs to be installed.
